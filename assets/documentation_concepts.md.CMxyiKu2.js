It is built around the concept of micro frontends, which are small, self-contained applications that can be developed, tested, and deployed independently.</p><p>This allows teams to work on different parts of the application without interfering with each other, and to release updates without affecting the rest of the system.</p><p>Extensions are the building blocks of OpenMFP, enabling the platform to acquire additional features. In fact, nearly every feature in OpenMFP is an extension.</p><p>The three most common types of extensions in OpenMFP are:</p><ol><li><p><strong>UI-only Micro Frontends</strong> - micro frontends are self-sufficient applications running within another application, also called the “microservices for the frontend”. They allow you to do independent releases, split up applications into smaller chunks, nd support the reuse of shared functionality and infrastructure. OpenMFP uses the <a href="https://luigi-project.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Luigi</a> framework to develop these micro frontends.</p><p>An OpenMFP micro frontend application should be able to work in a “micro frontend” mode, which means it should:</p><ul><li>Not show a Header, Footer or sidebar Menu.</li><li>It should use the Luigi Client for internal navigation to properly adjust the browser URL on navigate.</li><li>It should be able to consume the provided Luigi context and the backend APIs should be able to accept the provided JWT token.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Micro Frontends with Backend Service Dependencies</strong> - this option combines micro frontend with additional backend services such as Events.</p></li><li><p><strong>Service-only Extensions</strong> - Extensions which include only backend services.</p></li></ol><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>OpenMFP does not enforce any rules around how to build/deploy Extensions.
