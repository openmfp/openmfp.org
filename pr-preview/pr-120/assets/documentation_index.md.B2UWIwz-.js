Whereas classical UI integration techniques typically force teams to fully align their release and life cycle procedures, OpenMFP preserves the autonomy for teams to contribute independent capabilities and services, while not impeding the teams in their choice of technology and allowing them to independently release and life cycle their services.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>OpenMFP is an early preview version, designed to provide a demo environment and showcase the OpenMFP Portal for exploring the platform and offering valuable feedback. Please note that it is not yet complete and is still under active development. Your feedback is essential in helping us refine and improve the platform.</p></div><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Disclaimer</p><p>Some components of OpenMFP are being migrated to <a href="https://platform-mesh.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Platform Mesh</a>.

This diversity introduces several challenges:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Redundant Implementations</strong>: Common functions, such us authentication and authorization, are often developed independently by different teams, leading to duplication and increased complexity.</p></li><li><p><strong>Integration Difficulties</strong>: Services developed in isolation are challenging to integrate seamlessly, resulting in delays and higher maintenance costs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fragmented User Experience</strong>: Users often need to navigate multiple interfaces, hampering productivity and decreasing satisfaction.</p></li></ul><p>OpenMFP addresses these challenges by providing a unified interface that consolidates services, making it easier for both users and administrators to manage resources efficiently and securely.</p><h2 id="key-features" tabindex="-1">Key Features <a class="header-anchor" href="#key-features" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Key Features&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li>Authentication service.</li><li>A frontend OpenMFP Portal that integrates multiple services and their UIs.</li><li>An extensible control plane with API resources (planned).</li><li>An authorization service with an extensible permission model (planned).</li></ul>',10)])])}const u=n(o,[["render",r]]);export{h as __pageData,u as default};
