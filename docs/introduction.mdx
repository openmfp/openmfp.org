# Introduction


The Open Micro Frontend Platform (OpenMFP) project is an opinionated, “batteries-included” framework for building portals and complex web-based applications with enterprise qualities.

Key value propositions are the dynamic extension model and the inclusion of central shared services (e.g. for Authorization), which enable the seamless integration of UI capabilities from different teams and disparate organizations. Whereas classical UI integration techniques typically force teams to fully align their release and life cycle procedures, OpenMFP preserves the autonomy for teams to contribute independent capabilities and services, while not impeding the teams in their choice of technology and allowing them to independently release and life cycle their services.
