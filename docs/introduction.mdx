# Introduction


The Open Micro Frontend Platform (OpenMFP) project is an opinionated, “batteries-included” framework for building portals and complex web-based applications with enterprise qualities.

Key value propositions are the dynamic extension model and the inclusion of central shared services (e.g. for Authorization), which enable the seamless integration of UI capabilities from different teams and disparate organizations. Whereas classical UI integration techniques typically force teams to fully align their release and life cycle procedures, OpenMFP preserves the autonomy for teams to contribute independent capabilities and services, while not impeding the teams in their choice of technology and allowing them to independently release and life cycle their services.

OpenMFP is an early preview version designed to provide you with a demo environment for trying out the platform and providing valuable feedback. Please note that this is not yet a complete, and it is still under active development. Your feedback is crucial in helping us refine and improve.

## Why we need a Micro Frontend Platform?

Modern cloud environments are inherently complex, consisting of many services, each potentially with its own user interface and technology stack. This diversity presents several challenges:

- **Redundant Implementations**: Common functions like authentication and authorization are often independently developed by different teams, leading to duplication and increased complexity.
  
- **Integration Difficulties**: Services developed in isolation are challenging to integrate seamlessly, resulting in delays and higher maintenance costs.

- **Fragmented User Experience**: Users often need to navigate multiple interfaces, hampering productivity and decreasing satisfaction.

OpenMFP addresses these challenges by providing a single, unified interface that consolidates services, making it easier for both users and administrators to manage resources efficiently and securely.


## Key Features

- Authentication and authorization services.
- A frontend portal that integrates multiple services and their UIs.
- An extensible control plane with API resources.
- An authorization service with an extensible permission model.
