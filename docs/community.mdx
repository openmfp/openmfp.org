- TODO: we need to provide and document how the users can reach ot to use for questions, support and discussions.
Options: 
Enable github discussions: PROS(Integrated with GH, we can to keep everything in one place and manageable, easy to create issues or bugs from the discussions)
Create slack: PROS(Realtime communication) CONS (Limited history on free plan, we can really have someone dedicated to observe)
Open stack overflow: PROS(easily searchable knowledge base)  CONS: (No GitHub integration)
