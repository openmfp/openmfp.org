# Concepts

The Open Micro Frontend Platform (OpenMFP) aims to provide the opinionated, “batteries-included” platform for micro frontend architecture, enabling a well integrated, state of the art end user experience.

It consist of the following key components:

## Extensibility & Micro Frontend Architecture

Modern cloud platforms and enterprise cloud services are highly modular consist of many individual components that are developed autonomously. The quality of the complete solution and user experience depends on the quality of integration.

We have moved away from monolithic architectures towards a composition of solution capabilities. This is true for a decoupled architecture from a single provider with micro services, as well as for service mesh approaches involving different providers. Both scenarios call for micro frontends to support the need of composition on the user interface layer. 


## Authentication
Currently we make use of Keycloak for authentication and authorization. Keycloak is an open source Identity and Access Management solution aimed at modern applications and services. It makes it easy to secure applications and services with little to no code.

### Planned Features

#### Control Plane



### Authorization

The inclusion of a central ReBAC service (relationship based access control) addresses the important need of having a seamless user and permission management that supports the same extensibility and modularity for access control, removing friction from scenarios that span multiple components.
