# Installation
We will walk you through the steps to set up a functioning local setup using KIND (Kubernetes IN Docker).
OpenMFP leverages [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/), a tool designed to keep Kubernetes clusters synchronized with configuration sources, alongside [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/), a standalone tool for customizing Kubernetes resources. 
Together, these tools enable efficient and automated cluster management.

We will configure Flux to install, test and upgrade a demo app using
`OCIRepository` and `HelmRelease` custom resources.
Flux will monitor the Helm repository, and it will automatically
upgrade the Helm releases to their latest chart version based on semver ranges.

By the end, you'll have a working setup ready to explore the full potential of OpenMFP while managing your cluster efficiently.

## Prerequisites  

1. **Container Runtime**  
   Install either [Docker](https://www.docker.com) or [Podman](https://podman.io) to run the kind cluster:  
   - **Docker**: Version `27.0.0` or higher. Installation Guide [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)  
   - **Podman**: Version `5.1.0` or higher. Installation Guide [Install Podman](https://podman.io/get-started)  

   Ensure Docker or Podman is configured to use at least 12GB of memory.

    Usually Docker does not require any additional configuration, but for Podman you will need to run:
   ```sh
   podman machine stop
   podman machine init --rootful --memory=12240
   podman machine start
   ```

2. **Kind (Kubernetes IN Docker)**  
   To set up a local Kubernetes cluster, use [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/). Follow the [Kind Quick Start](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/) guide for more details. For macOS Installation via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) run:
    ```sh
    brew install kind
    ```

3. **Helm**  
   [Helm](https://helm.sh/) is required to bootstrap Flux. You can find detailed installation instructions [here](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/). For macOS Installation via Homebrew run:
    ```sh
    brew install helm
    ```

4. **Kubectl**  
   [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) is the Kubernetes command-line tool. You can install it using the following command:
    ```sh
    brew install kubectl
    ```
    For more installation options, refer to the [Kubectl Installation Guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/).

5. **GitHub setup**  
    Set `GH_USER` or install the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) to setup your environment for Flux:  
    - Specify your GitHub username by setting the `GH_USER` environment variable:  
        ```sh
        export GH_USER=<your-github-username>
        ```  
    - Alternatively, install the GitHub CLI For macOS Installation via Homebrew run:
        ```sh
        brew install gh
        ```

    Set a GitHub token to enable pulling OpenMFP Docker images, this token should have the `read:packages` scope.
    ```sh
    export GH_TOKEN=<your-github-token>
    ```

6. **Keycloak (Authentication Setup - Optional)**  
   You only need this step if you plan to use your own Keycloak instance. If not, a default Keycloak will be installed automatically during the setup process.
   To use your own Keycloak, set up the client secret as an environment variable:  
   ```sh
   export KEYCLOAK_SECRET=<keycloak-client-secret>

7. **Free Port 8000**  
   The local OpenMFP portal will use port `8000`. Ensure this port is not in use by another application before proceeding.  
   - On Linux/macOS, you can check and free the port with the following commands:
    ```sh
    lsof -i :8000
    kill -9 <PID> # Replace <PID> with the process ID using the port
    ```

## Bootstrap local environment
Once the prerequisites are in place, follow these steps to set up the local environment:

1.  **Clone the OpenMFP Repository**  
    Start by cloning the OpenMFP Helm charts repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/openmfp/helm-charts
    cd helm-charts
    ```

2.  **Run the Bootstrap Script**  
    The repository includes a script `local-setup/scripts/start.sh`, it contains all steps needed to bootstrap the local environment. 
    The script will take some time and it automate the following steps:
    - Create kind cluster called `openmfp`
    - Install flux
    - Prepare secrets
    - Apply flux deployment configuration

    To start the bootstrapping and local installation, run the following command:
    ```sh
    ./local-setup/scripts/start.sh
    ```

3. **Access the Local Environment**  
Once the bootstrap process finishes, you can access the local Demo OpenMFP Portal at: http://localhost:8000

## Remove the Cluster

If you want to delete the local environment and remove the KIND cluster, run the following command:

```sh
kind delete cluster --name openmfp
```
If the deletion is stuck validate that the container runtime (Docker or Podman) is started and running.

## Troubleshooting

If the bootstrap script does not successfully finish, connect to the `kind-openmfp` cluster, take the following steps to investigate:

1. Verify the cluster is running and accessible:
```sh
kubectl cluster-info --context kind-openmfp
```

2. Identify any pods that are not in the `Running` status:
```sh
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep -v Running
```

3. For pods that are stuck or failing, inspect the events for more details:
```sh
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n <namespace>
```
Review the `Events` section in the output to pinpoint and address the underlying issue.
